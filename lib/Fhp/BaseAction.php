/**
 * Base class for actions that can be performed against a bank server. On a high level, there are two kinds of actions:
 *  - requests for information (e.g. an account statement), which the bank server will return
 *  - transactions (e.g. a wire transfer to another account), which the bank server will execute.
 *
 * In part, this class is designed like futures/promises in concurrent programming. The outcome of the action (i.e. the
 * requested information or the execution confirmation of the transaction) becomes available in the future, possibly
 * much later than when the request was sent, in case the user needs to enter a TAN.
 * All action instances are serializable, so that the execution can be interrupted to ask the user for a TAN. Once the
 * TAN is available, the execution can resume either a couple seconds later in the same PHP process using the same
 * physical connection to the bank, or on the order of minutes later in a new PHP process with a newly established
 * connection to the bank. Note that the serialization only applies to selected relevant request parameters, and not to
 * the response. Thus it is only possible to serialize an action when its execution has been attempted but resulted in a
 * TAN request.
 * Actions that do not require a TAN will complete immediately.
 *
 * The implementation of an action consists of two parts: assembling the request to the bank, and processing the
 * response.
